# Utility tariff visualisation application
## Front-end: React
## Back-end: Django

This project consists of a React front-end application and a Django back-end application for visualizing utility tariffs.

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you set up and run both the front-end and back-end applications on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm (for React)
- Python 3.x and pip (for Django)

### Setting up the Back-end (Django)

1. Navigate to the back-end directory:
   ```
   cd path/to/backend
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment:
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   ```

3. Activate the virtual environment:
   - On Windows: `venv\Scripts\activate`
   - On macOS and Linux: `source venv/bin/activate`

4. Install the required packages:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

5. Run database migrations:
   ```
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

6. Start the Django development server:
   ```
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

The back-end server should now be running at `http://localhost:8000`.

### Setting up the Front-end (React)

1. Navigate to the front-end directory:
   ```
   cd path/to/frontend
   ```

2. Install the required npm packages:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the React development server:
   ```
   npm start
   ```

The front-end application should now be running at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Running Both Applications

To run both applications simultaneously:

1. Open two terminal windows or tabs.
2. In the first terminal, follow the steps to run the back-end Django application.
3. In the second terminal, follow the steps to run the front-end React application.

You can now access the full application by opening `http://localhost:3000` in your web browser.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
